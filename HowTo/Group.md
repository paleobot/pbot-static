# Group Node
## Instructions for data entry
PBot uses groups to restrict access to private, unpublished data. Only group members will be able to view, add, edit, or delete data entered as private data by the group. Group members can create private data when adding collections, descriptions, taxa (OTU), images, and schemas. Specimens added to private collections will inherit private status. 

Because only registered users can be added to a group, be sure all the individuals you would like to add to your group are registered as PBot users. However, members can be added and edited at any time, so you can create a group with only yourself as a member to get started.

## REQUIRED FIELDS:
**Name** – A unique identifier for the group. Group names should be short and specific to the purpose of the group.

**Purpose** – Provide a brief description of the group’s purpose so that users are clear on what data should and should not be included in this private data repository.

**Members** – You are automatically included in any groups you create. If  you would like to add other registered users to the group, click “ADD MEMBERS”, and then use either the dropdown menu or magnifying glass to add people. Continue to add members until your group is complete.

## OPTIONAL FIELDS - not applicable
