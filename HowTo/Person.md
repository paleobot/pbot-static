# Person Node
## Instructions for data entry
PBot uses Person to record limited, but specific identifying information about individuals. Individuals who will be added to the PBot database include users and published authors. Note, if you are a registered user, a Person Node has already been created for you.

PBot does check internally for duplicates when you submit a new Person Node, but the given name and surname must exactly match the current PBot entry, including capitalization. The best practices to prevent duplicates are to check for existing persons before entering new data and to enter as detailed information as possible to distinguish between individuals with similarities even if that information is not required (e.g., complete middle name).

Recommended process to check whether a person has already been entered in PBot:
* Make a list of all the people you would like to use in your data entry process. For example, create a list of authors for a reference.
* Go to PBot Explore, choose a Person search, and enter the Surname. Determine which members on your list still need to be entered.
* Enter new persons using the Add (+) function in PBot Workbench.

## REQUIRED FIELDS:

**Given** – Provide the given name of the individual being entered. Providing the full given name is preferred, but in cases when only an initial is available, do not provide a period after the initial (e.g., M).

**Surname** – Provide the surname of the individual being entered. When entering suffixes, include a comma before the suffix and period after the suffix (e.g., Surname, Jr.)

## OPTIONAL FIELDS:

**Middle name/initial** – Whenever possible, enter the individual’s complete middle name. If entering just an initial, do not include a period (e.g., M).

**Email** – Use standard email address formatting including the @ symbol and organization with domain (e.g., name@organization.edu).

**ORCID** – ORCID IDs are entered as a 16-digit number without hyphens. Formatting will be applied after the user moves to another field or clicks submit.
