Our vision is that when you click on "How to Use PBot", you would come to a landing page with
1. The workflow image
2. a button to download a pdf with the full user manual
3. buttons that will open pop-up windows with the tip sheet for each node. Markdowns have been created for each tip sheet.

Landing page.md does all this, but I am open to better buttons for downloading the full user guide and also opening pop-up windows with the tip sheet for each node.
