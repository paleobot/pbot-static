### Governance Structure 
All PBot decisions are currently made by our Core Team. In the future, PBot will transition governance to a Leadership Panel, who will be responsible for oversight of infrastructure, maintenance, budgeting, and expansion. Participation in the Leadership Panel will be incentivized through unique opportunities for authorship in collaborative works, inclusion in large, collaborative grant proposals, and professional networking.
