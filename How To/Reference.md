# Reference Node
## Instructions for data entry

PBot’s goal is for all stored data (Collections, Specimens, OTUs, Descriptions, Schemas, proposed Synonyms) to be associated with a published reference. However, as PBot is also a workbench for paleobotanical research, data can also be linked to informal, unpublished references (e.g., “Ellen’s Hanna Basin Research”) prior to publication. PBot uses references to ensure data quality, reproducibility, and tracking; however, PBot is not intended to be a substitute for publishing in peer-reviewed literature, nor is it intended to automatically generate comprehensive bibliographies. Note that all Reference nodes are publicly accessible to avoid duplication of records, even if data associated with that reference is private.

*Entering References:*
Before you begin entering a reference, make sure that Person nodes have already been created for each author. Should you realize mid-entry that a Person node does not exist for one of the authors, it is possible to edit the reference later to add the additional author after creating their Person node.

To enter a reference, first select the **Publication type** to see the required and optional fields specific to that reference type. Choose from journal article, standalone book (includes theses, monographs, compendiums, as well as other standalone books), edited book of contributed articles, contributed article in edited book, or unpublished.

**Prior to creating or editing a reference (excepting unpublished references), you must determine whether the Reference already exists in the Paleobiology Database (PBDB).** To do this, enter data for one or more fields in the PBot Reference form (recommendation: either title, journal and year, or one author), and then click the magnifying glass next to PBDB ID. A new window will appear with PBDB search results. If the reference already exists in PBDB, you can import the data into PBot by first clicking “Populate all fields”, and then clicking on the correct reference. Note that because author information is stored in PBot as Person nodes, you still need to manually enter authors (see instructions below under the “Author” required field).

## JOURNAL ARTICLE
### REQUIRED FIELDS: 
**Title** – Enter the entire article title and do not use abbreviations. If the title is not in English, enter the original title first and then enter an English-language translation in brackets.

**Year** – The year (include all four digits) in which the article was published.

**PBDB ID** – If the reference already exists in the Paleobiology Database, then this field stores the reference’s PBDB identification number. If the reference does not exist already in PBDB, this field may be left blank. See instructions at the beginning of this document (above Journal article) for instructions on searching PBDB.

**Authors** – Link each author’s Person node to the Reference. The “Order” field allows you to enter author order (numbers only). Click the magnifying glass to bring up a PBot search for Person nodes, enter search information, and choose the correct Person. Click “ADD AUTHORS” to search for the next author’s Person node. Make sure to enter all authors.

**Journal** – Enter the full title of the journal. Do not abbreviate.

**Volume** – Enter the volume number in which the article was published.

### OPTIONAL FIELDS: 
**Number** – Enter the issue number in which the article was published.

**First page number** – Enter the first page number of the article. If the pages are numbered with combinations of numbers and letters (e.g., “A-32”), put everything in and do not strip the letters. Do not put a hyphen after the page number.

**Last page number** - Enter the last page number of the article. If the pages are numbered with combinations of numbers and letters (e.g., “A-32”), put everything in and do not strip the letters. Do not put a hyphen before the page number.

**Notes** – Enter any additional comments you have about the reference.

**DOI** – The digital object identifier of the reference. Only enter the unique ID number - for example, enter “10.1086/663967”, not “https://doi.org/10.1086/663967”.

## UNPUBLISHED
Ideally, an unpublished reference should be a placeholder for an intended future publication. The reference information can be edited at any time; therefore once your manuscript is published, you can simply edit the Reference fields to match the final publication type and information (in other words, you will not need to individually edit every record in your publication dataset to change to the published version of the reference). For general entry of private data that does not yet have a designated intended publication, you can generate a Reference titled “Username’s Personal Workbench”, which serves as a generalized interim private workspace. 

### REQUIRED FIELDS: 
**Title** – Keeping in mind that all References are publicly accessible, enter an informative title that matches your comfort-level. Example titles include “SiteName flora project”, “Username’s SiteName research”, “Username’s TaxonName research”, “Username’s Personal Workbench”.

**Year** – Enter the current year (include all four digits) as a timestamp of when the unpublished reference was created.

**Authors** – Link each author’s Person node to the reference. The “Order” field allows you to enter author order (numbers only). Click the magnifying glass to bring up a PBot search for Person nodes, enter search information, and choose the correct Person. Click “ADD AUTHORS” to search for the next author’s Person node. Make sure to enter all authors.

**Description** – A short summary of the unpublished reference. Remember that all Reference nodes are publicly accessible.

### OPTIONAL FIELDS: 
**Notes** – Enter any additional comments you have about your unpublished reference, keeping in mind that this will be publicly accessible.
