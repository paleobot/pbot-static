# How to Register for PBot

PBot users must register to access PBot Workbench and to enter, edit, or delete data from the PBot database. To register, click the green “LOGIN” button on the top-right of the page. Then, click “REGISTER” (green font) below the login fields. 

After registration, PBot Users are automatically added as a Person node based on their registration information. You do not need to enter yourself as a person. If someone else has already created a Person node for you, then any information you add during registration will be added to that Person node.

## REQUIRED FIELDS:
**Given name** – Provide the given name of the individual being entered. Providing the full given name is preferred, but in cases when only an initial is available, do not provide a period after the initial (e.g., M).

**Surname** – Provide the surname of the individual being entered. When entering suffixes, include a comma before the suffix and period after the suffix (e.g., Surname, Jr.)

**Email** – Use standard email address formatting including the @ symbol and organization with domain (e.g., name@organization.edu).

**Why do you want a PBot account?** – PBot uses this field to determine if you are a human. Please enter a quick response for verification (e.g., I am a postdoc and will be entering data with Ellen Currano’s lab group.)

**Password** – Enter a password you will remember. At this time, we do not support automated password recovery. If you forget your password, please contact us at the pbot gmail address.

**Confirm password** – Re-enter your password to confirm accuracy.

## STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FIELDS:

**Middle name/initial** – Whenever possible, enter the individual’s complete middle name. If entering just an initial, do not include a period (e.g., M).

**Short bio** – Let the PBot community know who you are! In just a few sentences, tell us about your research goals using keywords so others can find you.

**ORCID** – ORCID IDs are entered as a 16-digit number without hyphens. Formatting will be applied after the user moves to another field or clicks submit.
