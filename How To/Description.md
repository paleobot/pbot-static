# Description Node
## Instructions for data entry

A Description node serves as a container that holds the character states that describe one or more Specimens. The ability to describe specimens in aggregate or as individual specimens provides the user with the flexibility needed for different methodologies and for entering published data for which specific specimen-level information is not known. If specimens are described separately (i.e., they each have separate Description nodes completed) and are determined later to belong to the same OTU, then the descriptions can be “merged” (reversibly) in the OTU’s page. The ability to track specimen-level descriptions can also be a useful tool for assessing variability in character states, preservation, or the later removal/ addition of specimens to an existing OTU record. 

**Workflow for making a description:**
1.	Generate a Description node. Here you will choose the Specimens being described and the Schema to be used for description. Submit.
2.	Select the Edit Description function and select your Description from the list. 
3.	Now you should see there is a “Character instances” accordion. The accordion is populated with the characters from the schema you selected. Open the accordion to see the character hierarchy of the schema and to submit character states!

## REQUIRED FIELDS: 
**Name** – Provide a unique and informative name for the Description. For example, the name can refer to the Specimen the Description is based on (UCMP 24678 preliminary description), or the Reference of the Description (e.g., Brown 1962’s G. nordenskioldii), or even the OTU that the Description will support (DE 124 morphotype aggregated). In some cases, it may also be helpful to list the Schema used in the Description Name (DE 124 MLA description). Ultimately, the name of the Description should be practical for workers; it is not used prominently in any public part of the database. 

**Schema** – Choose the Schema that will be used to make the Description. Only one schema can be used per Description node. If you need to describe a Specimen, or Specimens, using multiple schemas (for example a schema for leaf morphology and a schema for cuticle characters) then you will need to make two Description nodes for the Specimen(s).  A Specimen may have multiple Description nodes.

**References** – Choose an existing Reference, or References, for the Description. If the description record is based on a published description, choose that reference. If not published, you may choose a personal ‘working reference’ (see Reference Instruction sheet). Enter the order number for the Reference to indicate its priority in the reference list, with the most relevant publication as order 1. 

**Specimens** – Select the Specimen or Specimens that are being described. Add the first specimen by selecting from the drop-down list or by using the search tool. Additional specimens can then be added by clicking “ADD SPECIMEN”.

**Public or Group** – For public data, leave the box checked. For private data, uncheck the box, then from the Groups dropdown select the private data access groups to which this data record belongs. Note that a public Description must have at least one public Specimen. Once a record has been made public, it cannot be returned to a private group. 

## OPTIONAL FIELDS: 
**Written description** – Paste or type the written description of the Specimen or Specimens. This field allows users to preserve the original terminology used by the describing author, or to provide additional context to the Description that is not possible through the standardized character schema. Because different authors can provide differing descriptions of the same OTU based on specimens from different localities, the written description is recorded for the specific specimens being described, rather than on the OTU itself. Note that the diagnosis text is applied directly to the OTU.

**Notes**  – Enter notes about the Description that the enterer deems necessary to record. For private data undergoing research, this field can be used for research notes or memos to collaborators. Notes can be edited or deleted at any time.

## CHARACTER INSTANCES:
The character instances tab will be visible through the “edit Description” function after a Description node has been submitted. Open the accordion(s) to enter Character States from your chosen Schema. There may be a hierarchical set of accordions depending on how the Schema was designed. 

To record the Character States that comprise your description, click the green plus symbol that is under a Character that you want to record. A pop-up box will appear with a drop-down list of the States available for that Character. Once you select a State, press submit. Each submit creates a “Character instance”. 

To record variation in the States exhibited for a particular Character, you may choose to add more States for the same Character. The “Order” field allows you to indicate which of the States is more prevalent by numerically ordering them (note, the order is not an abundance, it is simply a relative ordering). If there is no priority for a particular Character, you may list all States as Order 1. The default is to order the States by the order in which they are entered.

You may edit or delete a character instance using the buttons to the far right of the character instance. 

You do not need to press the gray Submit button at the bottom of the page to save character instances. However, if you edit any Required or Optional fields, do make sure to press Submit.
