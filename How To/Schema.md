# Schema
## Instructions for data entry
The primary function of PBot Schemas is to support the development and use of community-sourced morphotype descriptions of plant parts (e.g., leaves) and notable features (e.g., cuticles). Each PBot Schema contains a curated collection of Characters (questions—e.g., What is the shape of a leaf?) and States (answers—e.g., ovate) for a specific purpose (e.g., leaf descriptions). Once a Schema is created, it can be used to describe Specimens and Taxa (OTUs) so that Specimens and Taxa (OTUs) can be compared and synonymized.

The information provided here is limited and additional training is strongly recommended.

## REQUIRED FIELDS: 
**Title** – For published schemas, enter the published title. For unpublished schemas, enter a unique and descriptive title related to the purpose of the schema. 

**Year** – For published schemas, enter the copyright date. For unpublished schemas, enter the year the schema was first entered in PBot.

**Purpose** – What problem is this schema solving? Enter a brief description. Is this a new and unique Schema, an update to an existing Schema, or the first time a published Schema is being entered into PBot? Is this Schema specific to a particular taxonomic group or time period? Also provide any specific circumstances when it is inappropriate to use this Schema and if an alternate Schema can be suggested, include a recommendation.

**Parts preserved** – Select parts preserved from the dropdown menu. Multiple parts can be selected at the same time. When selected, parts are highlighted in gray. Click outside of the dropdown menu to return to data entry.

**Referenc** – Whenever possible, select a published Reference. For unpublished schemas, an “unpublished reference” can be used as a temporary placeholder.

**Public or Group** – Schemas are set to Public, as published Schemas should always be part of the “Public” access group. To restrict access to unpublished Schemas, uncheck “Public.” Then select Group(s) as appropriate from the dropdown menu. Multiple Groups can be selected at the same time. When selected, Groups are highlighted in gray. Click outside of the dropdown menu to return to data entry. Note, once a record has been made public, it cannot be returned to a private group.

## OPTIONAL FIELDS:
**Acknowledgements** – Add acknowledgements that apply to the schema as a whole, just as you would in the acknowledgement section of a publication. Specific citations to acknowledge previously published characters or states can be included in character and state definitions.

**Notable features preserved** – Select all notable features from the dropdown menu. Multiple features can be selected at the same time. When selected, features are highlighted in gray. Click outside of the dropdown menu to return to data entry.
